Four score and seven years ago our

all men are created equal.

testing whether that nation, or
any nation so conceived and so dedicated,
can long endure. We are met on
a great battle-field of that war. We have
come to dedicate a portion of that
field, as a final resting place for those

nation might live. It is altogether
fitting and proper that we should do this."""
